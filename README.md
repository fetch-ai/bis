# Overwolf sample app

This repository contains sample apps that demonstrate some basic points and flows that are relevant when developing Overwolf apps:

- The apps will launch automatically when TFT starts
- Register to the overwolf.games.events API in order to receive real time events from the game.
- Define a custom hotkey to be used in-game
- Communication between the app windows according to our best practices 

## How to load the app
Under Overwolf's settings, choose Support tab and then Development options. Click the Load unpacked button and choose the relevant folder of this repository.

## Notes
Editing the author or app name in the manifest will prevent loading the app
as unpacked app.
